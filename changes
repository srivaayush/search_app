Build a flutter app to search hacker news.
You will be building an app using the HN Search API that lets users search for hacker news
posts and view details of each post.
● Home screen
○ Search field on the top
○ A list of search results below the search field
○ Entering a query in the search field triggers the search results API:

■ E.g. GET http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=test
○ Upon receiving results, populate the list of search results below
● Post detail screen
○ Upon clicking a search result, take the user to the post detail screen
○ Using objectID obtained from search results, call the Get item API to retrieve
post details
■ E.g. GET http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/items/12701272
○ On the detail screen, the following should be displayed
■ Title
■ Points
■ List of all comments (“children” field)
Note: The API is public and does not need any API keys. Documentation is available at
